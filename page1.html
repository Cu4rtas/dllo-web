        Document markup languages HTML support XHTML 1.1
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
        With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World
        Wide Web.[4]

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text
            and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to
            interpret the content of the page.

            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
            explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[5]
